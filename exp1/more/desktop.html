        <li>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the
            instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output
            (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing
            unit" at least since the early 1960s.[1] Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more
            specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer
            from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.[2]
        </li>
        <li>The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their
            fundamental operation remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic
            unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the
            ALU and store the results of ALU operations and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory)
            and execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other
            components.
        </li>
        <li>Most modern CPUs are microprocessors, meaning they are contained on a single integrated circuit (IC) chip.
            An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory, peripheral interfaces, and other components of a
            computer; such integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip (SoC). Some
            computers employ a multi-core processor, which is a single chip containing two or more CPUs called "cores";
            in that context, one can speak of such single chips as "sockets".[3]

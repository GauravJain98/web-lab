            <li> computer monitor is an output device that displays information in pictorial form. A monitor usually
                comprises the display device, circuitry, casing, and power supply. The display device in modern
                monitors is
                typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) with LED backlighting having replaced
                cold-cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlighting. Older monitors used a cathode ray tube (CRT).
                Monitors
                are connected to the computer via VGA, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), HDMI, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt,
                low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) or other proprietary connectors and signals
            </li>.
            <li>Originally, computer monitors were used for data processing while television receivers were used for
                entertainment. From the 1980s onwards, computers (and their monitors) have been used for both data
                processing and entertainment, while televisions have implemented some computer functionality. The
                common
                aspect ratio of televisions, and computer monitors, has changed from 4:3 to 16:10, to 16:9
            </li>.
            <li>Modern computer monitors are easily interchangeable with conventional television sets. However, as
                computer
                monitors do not necessarily include components such as a television tuner and speakers, it may not be
                possible to use a computer monitor as a television without external components.[1]

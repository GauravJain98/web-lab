            A computer mouse is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface.
            <br>
            This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth
            control<br>
            of the graphical user interface. The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system
            was <br>
            in 1968. Originally wired to a computer, many modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range radio
            communication<br>
            with the connected system. Mice originally used a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, but modern
            mice often<br>
            have optical sensors that have no moving parts. In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or
            more buttons<br>
            to allow operations such as selection of a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements,
            such as touch<br>
            surfaces and "wheels", which enable additional control and dimensional input.

        <li> computing, a computer keyboard is a typewriter-style device[1] which uses an arrangement of buttons or
            keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Following the decline of punch cards and paper
            tape, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input method for computers.
        </li>
        <li>Keyboard keys (buttons) typically have characters engraved or printed on them,[2] and each press of a key
            typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, producing some symbols may require pressing and
            holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence.[3] While most keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or
            signs (characters), other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or execute computer
            commands.
        </li>
        <li> normal usage, the keyboard is used as a text entry interface for typing text and numbers into a word
            processor, text editor or any other program. In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is
            generally left to the software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other key
            and reports all key presses to the controlling software. Keyboards are also used for computer gaming â€”
            either regular keyboards or keyboards with special gaming features, which can expedite frequently used
            keystroke combinations.
        </li>
        <li>A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as Windows'
            Control-Alt-Delete combination. Although on Pre-Windows 95 Microsoft operating systems this forced a
            re-boot, now it brings up a system security options screen.[4][5]
        </li>
        <li>A command-line interface is a type of user interface navigated entirely using a keyboard, or some other
            similar device that does the job of one.
